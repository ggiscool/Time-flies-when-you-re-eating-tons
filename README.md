### Overview
  Connect 5 is exactly like Connect 4, except that the board is one spot longer in each direction. Red and Blue players alternate placing pieces on the board, with the goal of getting 5 pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. In this version, Red goes first upon the start of each new game, and alternates turns with Blue.

## Deployment
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that I used as my web application deployment model. To view live, visit xxxxxxxxxxxxx.


### Approach
  I used the MVC (Models, Views and Controllers) file structure. I used all 7 RESTful routes and CRUD, and EJS partials. The dependencies I used included Bcrypt, EJS, Express, Express-session, JSON, Method-Override, Mongoose, Morgan, and Pretty-Error. I started with the index page/route, which I seeded with a few posts for testing, and the log-in page, since we had just learned that and it was fresh in my mind. I built out from there.

### Technical Difficulties
  I had quite a few technical difficulties while building this app. I got held up for days on trying to make a profile page that held only posts made my the user who is signed in, which put me behind a bit. I had a catch error that I couldn't figure out, so I literally just commented everything out and gave up. I came back a few days later and, with some help from classmates, was able to make it work. I am not naturally visually creative, so designing the color scheme for this app was a struggle for me.

### Future Implementations
  In the future, I would like to add a comment model, have the user only be able to delete posts and comments that they posted, and improve my css and sense of color.

### Tech Used
  -HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Express, Node.js, NPM MongoDB.
  -Atom for text-editing.

### Credits
Most of the photos I used are from google, but this application is just for educational purposes.

### Acknowledgments
