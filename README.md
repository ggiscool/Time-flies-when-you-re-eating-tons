## A site cataloging the best things I've ever eaten
### Created By: GG Gonzalez


### Overview
  This a blog about the best foods I've ever eaten. Anyone can make their own account and add their own posts abut their favorite meals they've had. Each post contains a photo, a caption, a blurb about the food, the location they had the food, and a link to the restaurant. There is a news feed of all posts on the site, and a profile page customized to each user, featuring only their posts.

## Deployment
  Heroku is a cloud platform as a service that I used as my web application deployment model. To view live, visit https://timeflieswhenyoureeatingtons.herokuapp.com/.


### Approach
  I used the MVC (Models, Views and Controllers) file structure. I used all 7 RESTful routes and CRUD, and EJS partials. The dependencies I used included Bcrypt, EJS, Express, Express-session, JSON, Method-Override, Mongoose, Morgan, and Pretty-Error. I started with the index page/route, which I seeded with a few posts for testing, and the log-in page, since we had just learned that and it was fresh in my mind. I built out from there.

### Technical Difficulties
  I had quite a few technical difficulties while building this app. I got held up for days on trying to make a profile page that held only posts made my the user who is signed in, which put me behind a bit. I had a catch error that I couldn't figure out, so I literally just commented everything out and gave up. I came back a few days later and, with some help from classmates, was able to make it work. I am not naturally visually creative, so designing the color scheme for this app was a struggle for me.

### Future Implementations
  In the future, I would like to add a comment model, have the user only be able to edit/delete posts and comments that they posted, tag/link to locations of restaurants on Google maps, make hover animations, be able to add photos by upload, add search functionality and tags, and improve my css and sense of color.

### Tech Used
  -HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Express, Node.js, NPM MongoDB.
  -Atom for text-editing.

### Credits
  Most of the photos I used are from google, but this application is just for educational purposes.

### Acknowledgments
  Thank you to all my classmates and TAs who helped me get through this project and create a functioning web application. Special thanks to Sean, Hector, Josefina, Liz, Madison, and Tyler for helping me with my many problems, and Foryst for being my CSS guru.
